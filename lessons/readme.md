# Lessons

Here are some lessons related to different aspects of the library, that could be useful to learn how to use it.
Each lesson has a topic described in its title: the code shows how to apply the topic presented and there is a **readme.md** file in each folder, with a deeper explanation of the main concepts.

## How to contribute

Any helps will be appreciated, in particular:
* new lessons to give explanations or inspiration: to contribute, the lessons must have the same format as the 'official' lessons, with a **readme.md** inside the folder.  
* fix typos, grammar or improve the quality of the language used.
